        A website for browsing and rating music albums. This application was part of my bachelors thesis. Recently i have started to rebuilding it from scratch (no old code remained) this is why its in a rough state.
        It never meant to hit production state i made it only to learn ASP.NET, WCF and recently unit testing. Front end is something i will focus on at a much later stage.
    </p>

    <p>It requires working MS SQL and database backup i have included. Connection string in WCF project needs to be adjusted.</p>
